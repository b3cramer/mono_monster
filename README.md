# Getting Started with Bazel in a Monorepo

This repository is generated by the Aspect CLI which adds a convenient layer over Bazel and Gazelle to automate the generation of build files.

## Pre-requisites

1. Install the Aspect CLI: [Installation Guide](https://docs.aspect.build/cli/#installation)  
2. Install Go: [Golang Installation Docs](https://go.dev/dl/)

## Intro Bazel Commands

`bazel build //...` will build the entire repo tree  
`bazel build //path/to/target:rule` will build the targeted resource  
`bazel run //path/to/target:binary_rule` will build and execute the targeted binary

### Example

Running `bazel run //examples:hello_world` will execute the bazel build on the target binary rule and then execute the script which, when run successfully, will produce the output:

```
Hello, World!
You just ran a shell script via Bazel run!
```
